_Written by Daniel Sage at the Biomedical Image Group (BIG), EPFL, Switzerland_

## Outline
The aim is to characterize the orientation and isotropy properties of a region of interest (ROI) in an image, based on the evaluation of the structure tensor in a local neighborhood. The theoretical background is fully described in this [PDF document] (http://bigwww.epfl.ch/demo/orientation/theoretical-background.pdf). The software OrientationJ automates the orientation analysis. It is a Java plug-in for ImageJ. OrientationJ has four functionalities: visual representation of the orientation, quantitative orientation measurement, making distribution of orientations and corner detection (Harris Corner).
